# ESPv2 Configurations

This directory contains examples of how to configure ESPv2.

Each folder contains three files:

1. **openapi_swagger.json**:  API producer defined [OpenAPI Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification).

2. **service_config_generated.json**: Service configuration generated by Google Service Management.
To generate this, deploy `openapi_swagger.json` to service management and run:

```shell script
gcloud endpoints configs describe "${CONFIG_ID}" \
  --project="${PROJECT}" \
  --service="${SERVICE}" \
  --format=json \
  > service.json
```

3. **envoy_config.json**: Envoy static bootstrap configuration generated by [Config Manager](../src/go/README.md)
for the corresponding `service_config_generated.json`.  It is formated by "python -m json.tool"

There are a few more configurations in the [internal bootstrap configuration tests](../tests/env/testdata/testdata/README.md) directory,
but these are primarily for ESPv2 developers.

## [Auth](auth)

Configurations of JWT Authn filter.

## [Dynamic Routing](dynamic_routing)

Configurations of Dynamic Routing, where ESPv2 acts as an API Gateway.

## [Service Control](service_control)

Configurations of authorization by API key and limiting by quota.
