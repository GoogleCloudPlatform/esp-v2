# This script will use Prow docker image to make artifacts.
# The intended use case is to build envoy binary to run in the Docker image
# based on python:3.6-buster.
# Details: some developing boxes may have newer libc so their envoy binary
# could not run in image based on python:3.6-buster which has older libc.
#
# To build an envoy binary, run
#
#    scripts/docker_make.sh build-envoy
#

# The latest Prow docker image used for prow build/tests
# It is built from docker/Dockerfile-prow-env
IMAGE=gcr.io/cloudesf-testing/gcpproxy-prow:latest
