# Envoy Filters

This directory contains code which, when built, will be compiled together with
[Envoy][Envoy Home] as [HTTP filters][HTTP Filters]. This
[Envoy filter example][Envoy filter example] may help see how this is done.

The filters are then configured to be used by envoy in one of two ways:

## Bootstrap Configuration

Filters are configured in the `listeners` section of the `envoy.yaml` [bootstrap] file.
See [this example][example envoy] for details.

```yaml
filter_chains:
  - filters:
    - name: envoy.filters.network.http_connection_manager
      config:
        ... other config options ...
        http_filters:
          ... list of filters...
```

## Config Manager

See the
[Config Manager documentation][Config Manager] for more details.
