# Path Rewrite filter

This filter can be configured to modify request path when sending to upstream.

The path can be modifed in two ways
*  prepend a fixed prefix to the path
*  change into a fixed path. This is for sending request to Google Cloud Function.
   Its HTTP trigger URL is a fixed name.

This filter will be funtional independently.
